# DO NOT USE THIS
use [listenbrainz-rs](https://github.com/InputUsername/listenbrainz-rs) instead

This is just a temporary fork with some merged pull requests to allow the CI of [listenbrainz-cli-tools](https://github.com/RustyNova016/listenbrainz-cli-tools)
to work. Concider it as a nighly version of https://github.com/InputUsername/listenbrainz-rs with selective feature merging.

I **will** break compatibility, and I **wont** care about your crates. listenbrainz-rs is still actively maintained, so use it instead.
